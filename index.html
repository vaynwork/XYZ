        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>This is the example and documentation website for the zoon framework. I've designed it to be fully modular and fit most use cases. zoon is constantly evolving, changing and improving as I learn more about designing software. I'm primarily creating this framework for use in my own work so I can have stylistic consistency across all of the sites that I work on, but I plan for it to be customisable and approachable enough for others to use in their own creations.</p>
        <p>zoon aims to be super simple to setup and get started with. All you need to do to start using it is add a link to the main style sheet in the head of your HTML file. This will instantly give you access to all of the different classes and stylings that zoon provides.</p>

        <h3>zoon_config.css</h3>
        <p>If you would then like to customise your zoon setup you can add the zoon_config.css template file locally and make changes to customise how zoon looks. This file is designed to let you make big changes easily without having to edit large parts of your HTML. It makes use of CSS variables that will override the default variables that the theme comes with. It is highly recommended that you use this file alongside zoon to get the most out of it.</p>

        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>A site built with zoon should work across all devices and all browsers. Everything should have fallbacks available in case fonts or certain stylings are unavailable.</p>

        <h3>Contextuality</h3>
        <p>Not every part of a style should need to be applied manually. zoon will apply certain stylings for you automatically based on the context of what you're writing.</p>

        <h3>Flexbox</h3>
        <p>zoon uses flexbox for properly sorting your content on the page. It allows content to be shown in a more interesting fashion and have a great level of responsiveness as it automatically changes to work with smaller viewports.</p>
