XYZ is my own personal design language and framework. I've designed it to be fully modular and fit most use cases. XYZ is constantly evolving, changing and improving as I learn more about designing software.

This repo contains all files for the XYZ style. Each branch of this repo represents a different application and is updated seperately.

<h4 align="center" href="tree/base">Base</h4>
This is the main version of XYZ. Other branches of XYZ are built from this one.

<h4 align="center" href="tree/jekyll">Jekyll</h4>
This is designed to work with Jekyll powered webpages. More information on setting this theme can be found on the README for that branch
